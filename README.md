Revefi integrates with dbt Core to help connect the dots between your data issues and your dbt models [e.g. model code changes].Â 

Follow the steps below to set up the integration:

- Make sure you have python (version 3.8 or above) installed on your machine

- Run pip install git+https://github.com/revefi/dbt_python_client.git to install the revefi-dbt-client package

- Separately, you will have received a Revefi Auth token; keep that in a secure place (like your password manager)

- In a terminal, run the command `python3 -m revefi-dbt-client.upload dbt --token <auth-token> --project_folder <project-folder>`, where `<auth-token>` is the token you received in Step b) above and `<project-folder>` is 
the Project folder you have created for the dbt.

## Note

The uploader assumes that the dbt target path is set to "target" within the project folder. If you are using some other target path, you may override the default behavior with

`python3 -m revefi-dbt-client.upload dbt --token <auth-token> --project_folder <project-folder> --target_folder <target-folder>`
